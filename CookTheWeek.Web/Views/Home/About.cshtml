                                Hi, I'm Yana, the founder of CookTheWeek. As a busy mom passionate about homemade dinners, I was always searching for new recipes and ways to optimize grocery shopping. Inspired by my experiences and daily meal prep challenges, I created CookTheWeek—a user-friendly app designed to help busy parents plan and prepare delicious meals with ease.
